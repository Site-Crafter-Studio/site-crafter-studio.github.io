        <h2>Project purpose</h2>
        <p>Site Crafter Studio was created as a senior project for the Liberal Arts and Engineering Studies program at Cal Poly, during Nicole's final year at the university. <br><br>
          There is currently no website/location in existence that contains everything that a student needs to know about easily creating your own HTML/CSS website. If you are interested in building one, it takes a lot of research and web searching to find out how to tackle different issues. Creative students interested in technology, design, or writing lack the resources and guidance it requires to create a well-designed and functioning site to demonstrate their strengths for networking and job recruitment in a short amount of time.<br><br></p>
